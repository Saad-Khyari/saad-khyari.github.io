			<br><br><h2>IoT Seminar with <b>Mr.Ali Ulker</b>: Arduino and its applications  </h2>
            <center><img src="images/seminar1.jpg" alt=""></center>
			<p>Firstly we need to know what is <b> IoT(Internet Of Things)</b> It refers to the network of physical objects, devices, vehicles, and other items embedded with sensors, software, and connectivity that enables them to collect and exchange data over the internet. In simple
                 terms, IoT is about connecting everyday objects to the internet and enabling them to communicate and interact with each other, as well as with humans. </p>

<h3>•Intoducing Adruino</h3>
<center><img src="images/act6-img2.jpg" alt=""></center>
<p><b> Arduino</b> is an open-source electronics platform that consists of both hardware and software components. It is designed to simplify the process of creating interactive projects and prototyping electronic devices. Arduino boards are based on microcontrollers, which are small 
    integrated circuits that contain a processor, memory, and input/output pins.</p>

		<h3><b>•Tips to protect your Adruino Devices</b> </h3>	
        <ol>
     <li><b>Employ secure communication</b> </li>
    <p> When communicating with your Arduino device over a network or the internet, utilize safe protocols like as HTTPS or MQTT using TLS/SSL encryption. This helps to safeguard your data from eavesdropping and unwanted access.</p>
    <li><b>Implement authentication and authorization</b></li>
    <p> TAdd robust authentication techniques like as username/password or token-based authentication if your Arduino gadget interfaces to a network or cloud service. This prevents unauthorized people or devices from accessing and controlling your Arduino device.</p>
    <li><b>Apply firmware updates</b></li>
    <p>Keep your Arduino board's firmware and libraries up to date by applying firmware updates. Manufacturers issue firmware upgrades on a regular basis to resolve security vulnerabilities and enhance device performance. Check for updates on a regular basis and apply them as needed.</p>
   <li><b>Physical security</b></li>
   <p> Keep your Arduino devices safe by keeping them in secure areas or enclosures. This protects the device and its important data from unwanted physical access, manipulation, or theft.</p>
   <li><b>Employ secure coding techniques</b></li>
   <p>To reduce vulnerabilities, use secure coding methods while programming your Arduino. Prevent buffer overflows, input validation difficulties, and other typical programming errors that attackers might exploit. To avoid injection attacks, thoroughly validate and sanitize inputs. </p>
<li><b>Unused features</b></li>
<p>Turn off any unused or unwanted features, ports, or services on your Arduino board. This minimizes the attack surface and restricts hackers' possible access sites.</p>
<li><b>Use strong passwords</b></li>
<p> If your Arduino device has an administrative interface or network access, use strong, unique passwords. Use password management solutions to save and generate strong passwords instead of utilizing default credentials.</p>
<li><b>Network segmentation</b></li>
<p>Consider segmenting your network to isolate your Arduino devices from important systems or sensitive data. In the event of a breach, this offers an extra layer of protection and prohibits unauthorized access or lateral movement.</p>
</ol>
<h3>•Reflections:</h3>	
<p>Based on the actions described, it is clear that cybersecurity is critical even for Arduino devices. Despite their simplicity and emphasis on physical computing, Arduino devices are susceptible to a variety of cybersecurity threats. Proactively protecting these devices helps to maintain the integrity and privacy of the data they manage.</p>
 <p>
    It is critical to secure communication channels, especially when delivering data through networks like the internet. The use of secure protocols and encryption techniques provides an additional degree of security against eavesdropping and unwanted access. Similarly, adopting robust authentication and permission methods protects Arduino devices from illegal control and access.</p>
